🇮🇳 Indian Culture App
A web application built with Express.js and EJS to explore Indian culture interactively. The app serves random inspirational quotes from Indian leaders, traditional recipes, and cultural festivals. It dynamically generates content using a simple, clean interface and runs on a local Node.js server.
Users can click "Get Random Content" to receive a new Indian quote, recipe (like Paneer Butter Masala), and festival info (like Diwali or Pongal) on each refresh. The project uses nodemon for live reloading and is ready to deploy or share via GitHub.
Perfect for learning Express, EJS templating, and building themed web apps with cultural content.
